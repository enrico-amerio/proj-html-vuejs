# Everlead Homepage

This project was created as part of the final exam for the **Boolean Full Stack Web Developer** course. It is a faithful replica of the homepage of the **Everlead** website, built to consolidate knowledge and skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vue.js**.

The goal of the project was to practice and showcase frontend development techniques, including layout design, responsive design, and component-based architecture using Vue.js.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The homepage is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Vue.js Components**: Vue.js is used to create reusable components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Clean and Modern Design**: The design closely mimics the original Everlead homepage, using HTML and CSS for styling.
- **Smooth Interactions**: The project includes basic interactions, such as hover effects and smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and markup of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout using CSS (including Flexbox and Grid).
- **Vue.js**: For managing the app's frontend and component-based architecture.
